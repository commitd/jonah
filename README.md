If you have `serve` which you can install via:

```
yarn global add serve
```

Then just run:

```
serve
```

If not, and you have Python,  you can serve this:

```
# For Python 2:
python -m SimpleHTTPServer 5000

# For Python 3:
python3 -m http.server 5000
```

Either way you can view the documentation in your local browser at http://localhost:5000

```
open http://localhost:5000
```
