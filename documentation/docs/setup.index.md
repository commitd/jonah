title: Setting up Ketos
---

Getting started with Ketos is designed to be straight forward, so you can head to the [Quick start](setup.quickstart.html) to get going.

You'll need a few [software requirements](setup.requirements.html) installed on your system, and some data [ingested](setup.baleen.html).

Once you are up and running you might want to change the [configuration](setup.configuration.html), or deploy as [service](setup.installation.html) or using [Docker](setup.docker.html).
